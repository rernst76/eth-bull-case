Anyone who is insisting Bitcoin is not a scarce asset does not understand how the concept of scarcity is derived from cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin is a combination of the code, computers, people and amount of money that is participating in the network. It is the combination of these things that makes it valuable.

<TODO: expand on each component of the network>

I could copy the Bitcoin code, make slight changes to it and deploy a new crypto called “FunkyDonkeyCoin”. It would be a worthless network with a single participant (me), secured by nearly zero computational power (my computer). There is only one reason why anyone would possibly want to buy one of my donkey tokens: for the comedic/meme value of having something called FunkyDonkeyCoin that uses a picture of a retarded looking cross-eyed donkey as its symbol. “Dogecoin” is a real life dog-themed version of FunkyDonkeyCoin, and even that has value (although I would agree that it is not sustainable). The bottom line is that the Bitcoin code can be copied, but the network of computers, people and money cannot.
