There is an idea floating around that Bitcoin is used by criminals and terrorists. They forgot to mention that the ledger is 100% transparent and public. Transactions can and are already being tracked by intelligence agencies. If anything needs to be said about Bitcoin is that it makes it easier to track and catch criminals. The traditional banking and financial systems are much better suited for money laundering activities (especially considering that criminal charges are rare occasions, and that fines are often lower than the profits gained from engaging in money laundering).
