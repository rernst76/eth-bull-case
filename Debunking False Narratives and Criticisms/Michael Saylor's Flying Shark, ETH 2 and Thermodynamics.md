Michael Saylor’s statement about how Ethereum is trying to be a flying shark is clear evidence he does not understand what it is. Ethereum is not trying to be a shark, or a bird, or any other concrete immutable thing for that matter. Ethereum is a shapeshifter. It is the shark hunting for prey in the deep ocean, and the eagle ruling the skies. Ethereum is many things at the same time - it was designed to be this way. It is a value agnostic network just like the internet is a data agnostic network. Michael also suggested that ETH 2.0 is a “totally different beast”, and that he would have to wait for that to come out to have an opinion about it. Again, this is evidence that he does not understand Ethereum and what the 2.0 upgrade is all about. Ethereum 2.0 is a continuation of technical improvements that will allow for the value proposition of Ethereum to be fully realized. The planned changes and their respective cryptoeconomic impact have been extensively discussed by the community. Anyone who has looked at the information should be able to understand its value and anticipate results before it is fully implemented.
